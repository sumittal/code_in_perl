# You are given an integer NN. Print the factorial of this number.
#
# N!=N×(N−1)×(N−2)×⋯×3×2×1
# N!=N×(N−1)×(N−2)×⋯×3×2×1
# Input 
# Input consists of a single integer NN, where 1≤N≤1001≤N≤100.
#
# Output 
# Print the factorial of NN.
#
# Example 
# For an input of 2525, you would print 1551121004333098598400000015511210043330985984000000.
#
# Note: Factorials of N>20N>20 can't be stored even in a 64−bit64−bit long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.
#
# We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.
