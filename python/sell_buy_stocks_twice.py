"""
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.
Note:
A transaction is a buy & a sell. You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Analysis
This can be solve by "devide and conquer". We use left[i] to track the maximum profit for transactions before i, 
and use right[i] to track the maximum profit for transactions after i. 
You can use the following example to understand the Java solution:

Prices: 1 4 5 7 6 3 2 9
left = [0, 3, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8]
right= [8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
The maximum profit = 13
