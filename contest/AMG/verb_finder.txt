Verb usage/meaning finder
-------------------------

If you access this API https://en.wiktionary.org/w/api.php?format=json&action=query&titles=gripe&rvprop=content&prop=revisions&redirects=1
you will get a json response that is rendered in page https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gripe.

This page (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gripe) accesses the above API and gets the response and formats it as shown in the web page.

What you are expected to do is write a script that

1] Will take a word as input
2] Invoke the above API (instead of gripe in the above example, replace with your word - rest of params can stay the same)
3] Pull the section titled ==English== (as there can be several languages - each delmited by the ==<Language>== format.  
   For the above example of gripe, the English section extends from ==English== to ==North Frisian==.  Instead of ==North Frisian== it can be any ==<Language>==.  
   What you are guaranteed is that it will be enclosed between double "="; ie ==
4] Under the English section locate Verb subsection; this could be started with the text ===Verb=== or ====Verb====.  
   Under the verb subsection, find the first line that begins with a # (not ## or ###) and print that line as the meaning of the verb.  
   That would be meaning/usage of the verb.
5] If English section or the Verb subsection under English section does not exist, print an error

Some pointers/hints
-------------------

Line breaks are denoted by \n in the response from the API
It would help if you take one of the API responses and indent it VI using the number of "=" as indents.   
That is, the wiki format uses the number of "=" to specify indents for the headings.You can correlate by looking at the webpage
