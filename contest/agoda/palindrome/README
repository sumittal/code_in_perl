How to run:
1) Build the image, i.e.:
   docker build -t test/palindrome .
2) Run a python program of checking palindrom in new container:
   docker run test/palindrome python src/isPalindrome.py 'inputstring'

Efficiency:
There are muliple way to writing the program, but i chose regex to chop off the non alphanumeric charecters from the input string and then checked if it is palindrome or not. I used 'timeit' module to benchmark the code which was very much faster than other alternatives.

Other alternative to ignore the special chars could be:
string = "''.join(ch for ch in string if ch.isalnum())
